v0.0.7
: This release is mostly a code re-organization due to changes in how Go modules are integrated. The packages osf, fountain, and fdx are not part of the scripttool code base easing management of the code. Those modules are largely stable. It's been years since I've changed them.  The scripttool itself has bee restructure but contains much of the functionality of previous release. A major change is how the command line is structured. I am now using a `CMD VERB [OPTIONS] MODIFIERS` structure where each "verb" may have its own set of options in the future. I've also updated the repository build process to use Pandoc to generate man pages, the website is not built using Pandoc and pdtk. The old Makefile and Python scripts have been replace by a two new Makefile (i.e. Makefile, website.mak). Added support for the "characters" verb listing the characters found in a fountain formatted screenplay.
